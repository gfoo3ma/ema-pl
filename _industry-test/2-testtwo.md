# TEST 2 

The gas industry is of vital importance, not only to our nation’s own generation of power but as a driver of economic growth. Similar to the electricity market, the gas sector is structured to encourage competition. To further enhance our energy security, one of the major developments in recent years was the commencement of operations of our Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal. The LNG terminal allows Singapore to source for gas globally, to complement piped natural gas that we receive from Indonesia and Malaysia. Beyond this core operation, the terminal enhances Singapore’s position as a centre for LNG trading in Asia, and also has the potential to offer ancillary services like LNG storage.
