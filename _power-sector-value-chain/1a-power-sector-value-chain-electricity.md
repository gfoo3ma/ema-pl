# The Electricity Sector  
Singapore’s electricity grid is one of the most reliable in the world, logging an interruption time of less than one minute on average per customer annually. Singapore’s infrastructure is heavily dependent on electricity, so maintaining a secure and affordable energy supply is essential.

Our electricity market is open and competitive. As the regulator, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) issues licenses to key players such as generation companies, retailers and wholesalers. We promote effective competition in the energy market, ensure reliable energy supply and develop a dynamic energy sector for Singapore. Regulatory measures are also in place to strengthen the overall resilience of the power sector, and enhance Singapore’s energy security.
